Present menu to type in path to file

Create arrays of nodes of size given by graph document

Format is (Source Node) (Destination Node) (Distance)
create distance matrix [Source] [Destination] = [Distance]
---aside since the max size for an array i0s 2,147,483,647 or 2gb limit we need to make either an array of arrays containing and int or create a struct or class

CLASS--Node

Visted Bool
Array Distance[i] = Distance I=nodes
methods:
set home node(int i)
	distance[i] = 0
set node distance(int node, int dist)
	distance[node] = dist
int get node dist(int node)
	return distance[node]
